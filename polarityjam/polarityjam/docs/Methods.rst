The methods that are used in polarityjam are listed on this page. Whenever necessary, a brief summary
of the methodology is provided.

Segmentation
++++++++++++

Segmentation of input image(s) are currently done with `cellpose <https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose>`_.

Cellpose is a generalist algorithm for cell and nucleus segmentation.
Cellpose uses a neural network that was trained to predict horizontal and vertical gradients of
topological maps, together with a binary map indicating whether or not a pixel is inside a region
of interest. The topological maps were previously created with the help of ground-truth masks.
Following the combined gradients in a process known as gradient tracking, grouping together
pixel that converge to the same point and combining results with the information from the binary mask,
precise cell shapes can be recovered.



Cell properties
+++++++++++++++

Most cell properties are extracted from a `scikit-image <https://scikit-image.org/>`_ python library.
More specifically, we use the `regionprops <https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.measure.html#skimage.measure.regionprops>`_
module of scikit-image. It allows the user to measure properties of labeled image regions.


Region adjacency graph (neighborhood statistics)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Our neighborhood statistic is calculated with the aid of a python module called `pysal <https://pysal.org/>`_  in
combination with the scikit-image graph implementation. Each cell is modelled as a node in the graph.
Additionally, a region of interest (ROI) can be specified. This feature is included in the graph
structure and a `morans I <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moran%27s_I>`_ correlation analysis can be performed.
